# Task 2: Data Visualization and Storytelling

## Overview
This repository contains my submission for Task 2 of the Elevate Labs Data Analyst Internship. I analyzed the Sample - Superstore.csv dataset to create a dashboard that tells a compelling story about sales trends, profitability, and optimization opportunities. Using Power BI Desktop (a free tool), I focused on business insights such as identifying high-performing categories and recommending discount adjustments to boost profits.

The narrative: "Uncovering Profit Drivers and Optimization Opportunities in Superstore Sales" â€“ highlighting top categories, regional variations, yearly trends, and actionable recommendations.

## Key Visuals and Insights
- **Bar Chart (Sales by Category)**: Shows Technology as the leading category in sales. Insight: Prioritize inventory and marketing for Technology to drive revenue growth.
- **Scatter Plot (Profit vs. Sales by Region)**: Reveals correlations, with Central region showing high sales but low profits due to discounts. Insight: Optimize pricing in underperforming regions for 10-15% margin improvement.
- **Line Chart (Sales Trend Over Time)**: Displays year-wise growth (2014-2017), with a recovery after 2015. Insight: Capitalize on upward trends with seasonal strategies to sustain momentum.
- **Treemap (Profit by Sub-Category)**: Highlights hierarchy, identifying losses in items like Tables. Insight: Reduce discounts in Furniture sub-categories to recover profits.

These visuals avoid clutter, use minimal colors, and emphasize business takeaways with added context in titles and annotations.

## Files
- **Sample - Superstore.csv**: The dataset used for analysis (sales, profit, categories, regions, etc.).
- **task2.pbix**: The Power BI file containing the full dashboard.
- **task2_Dashboard.pdf**: Exported PDF of the visual report (main deliverable).
- **Screenshots/**: Folder with individual chart images for reference.

## Approach
1. Imported the CSV into Power BI Desktop and explored the data for key metrics (Sales, Profit, Category, Region, Order Date).
2. Selected appropriate chart types: bar for comparisons, scatter for relationships, line for trends, treemap for hierarchy.
3. Customized visuals to highlight insights, added titles/context for storytelling, and arranged them into a single dashboard page.
4. Focused on business recommendations (e.g., discount optimizations) rather than raw data, per task hints.
5. Exported as PDF and prepared this repo for submission.

Tools: Power BI Desktop (free alternative to paid versions). No paid features were used.

If needed, the dashboard can be opened in Power BI for interactive exploration (e.g., filters by region). This project helped me master visual storytelling with data.
